# JCopy
This is a simple file copying/multiplying/cloning tool. It's very similar to Atomic Warez Leecher. Written in Java with Swing GUI.

It's a nice alternative to already existing tools. Open source, malware free, cross-platform from the box.

Don't ask me why you need this tool, don't ask me what to do with it.
